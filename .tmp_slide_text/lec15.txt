Note:
  • The standard deviation (SD) of an estimator (like X ) usually depends
    on population parameters we don’t know (like σ).

Problem: Birthweight                                      n

Suppose we collect two samples of infants of low SES
moms. The first sample contains 100 infants and second is
400 infants. The mean in both samples is 115 oz. and the
sample standard deviation is 24 oz in both samples.

What is the standard error of the sample mean in each
sample?

A. 𝑆𝐸 𝑋# is the same in both samples
B. 𝑆𝐸[𝑋! ]=0.24, 𝑆𝐸[𝑋" ]=0.12
C. 𝑆𝐸[𝑋! ]=2.4, 𝑆𝐸[𝑋" ]=1.2

How accurate is the estimate of the fraction of voters that would vote
for Youngkin?

    • Is it equal to the true percentage? Why not?

    • Is it close to being equal? How close?

Sampling Details
  Population. Denote the true (but unknown) percentage of
               adults favoring Youngkin with the symbol p.

  Sample. WP/GMU randomly asks 1,107 registered voters their opinions.

  Probability model. Define a random variable for each individual:

            Xi = 1 if individual i is for Youngkin, and 0 if not,
                                 for each of i = 1, 2, ..., 1107.

                                    ^
    The sample percentage in favor (p=0.45) is the sample average of the
    observed X’s.

To assess whether this is an accurate estimate of the unknown
percentage favoring Youngkin (p), we need to estimate the probability
                ^
distribution of p.

 Even though we don’t know true p, we can still do a good job estimating
 the accuracy of the estimator.

Margin of error
For this sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the maximum
margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points.


    Interpretation:
        • Suppose WP/GMU conducts 100 polls of 1107 adults
        • And suppose, in each case, we constructed our sample average
          and SE in this fashion.
        • Then, in about 95 cases out of 100, the true (unknown) percentage
          of the population supporting Youngkin would be within the (2 SE)
          margin of error – which is about 3 percentage points.
        • Or, in only about 5 out of the 100 cases, would the true (unknown)
.          percentage supporting Youngkin be outside that range.

 So what happened with the Virgina
 governor’s election?




Youngkin outperformed this poll by 5.6 points.

Assessing the poll
Youngkin outperformed this poll by 5.6 points.

If the truth was that Youngkin had support of 50.6% of voters, what is the
probability that the poll would be off by 5.6 points?

Convergence in Probability
Let S1, S2, …, Sn, … be a sequence of random variables.


    p
Sn ! µ i↵ Pr(|Sn             µ|      )!0 8 >0

     p
Sn ! µ i↵ Pr(|Sn                µ|      )!0 8 >0

If this is true, we can also say:

  • plim Sn = µ
  • Sn converges in probability to µ
  • Sn is a consistent estimator of µ
