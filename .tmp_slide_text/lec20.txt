Agenda for today
• Review of parametric tests


• The Chi-square, F, and t distributions


• The Univariate Chi-square test
   • Does an observed sample come from a known
     multinomial distribution?
   • Generalizing this idea to test if a sample comes from
     any known distribution

Name that test
For each of the scenarios, you should
• name the appropriate test,
• precisely state the null and alternative hypotheses, and
• name the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis



a) You have a sample of 125 adults age 65 and over from
    Watkins Glen and you have measures of their
    cholesterol level. Is the average cholesterol level of
    seniors in Watkins Glen significantly different from the
    national average of 199?

Name that test
a) You have a sample of 125 adults age 65 and over from
    Watkins Glen and you have measures of their
    cholesterol level. Is the average cholesterol level of
    seniors in Watkins Glen significantly different from the

You should run a two-sided one sample z-test where H0 is that
E[cholesterol]=199 and the alternative is that it is not. Under H0, the test
statistic is approximately standard normal.

c) You collect a sample of 300 young adults (age 20--25)
    from Lansing and measure their cholesterol. 30% have
    levels over 200. Is this proportion significantly different
    from the proportion of seniors with levels over 200 in a
    separate sample of 400?

The simplest test to use here is the two independent sample proportion test
where H0 is the fraction of young adults in Lansing with high cholesterol is equal
to the fraction of seniors in Lansing with high cholesterol. The null hypothesis is
that the fractions are NOT the same.

Under H0, the test statistic is approximately standard normal.

d) You have a sample of 500 seniors and observe their
    race and body-mass index. Is the race distribution

    who are thin or normal weight significantly different from
    the race distribution for seniors who are overweight or
    obese?

  Trick question: We will learn how to test whether categorical variables
  in two samples are drawn from the same discrete distribution later
  today.

  The closest you can do with what we’ve learned so far is a proportion
  test for one of the categories.

K-Multinomial Random Variables
                 Y ~ km (n, p1, p2, …, pk)

• Y is a vector of k elements.
• All the p’s add up to 1
• n trials, k possible outcomes of each.
• Yk is the number of times we draw the kth outcome.

  selected with equal probability. If we count the number
  of each digit, how are those counts distributed?

We want our random digits to be independent, but we haven’t tested that.


If each digit is equally likely AND each digit is independent of the others,

We can even use the Chi-square test as a test of normality.

A few notes:
• To test if data is from a normal with a known mean and variance,
  standardize the data and then test that the resulting data are drawn from a
  standard normal.
• Optimal choice of quantity and location of cutoffs is beyond the scope of
  the class.
• If you are generically testing for normality, you plug in estimates of the
  mean and variance AND take away two degrees of freedom.


Next time we’ll talk about Bivariate Chi-Square tests.
