Hypothesis Testing
 Is something we have observed “real”, or did it happen just by chance…?


 Examples:
   • Sex discrimination in hiring and promotions

   • Product safety (e.g. Ford Explorers in rollover accidents)
   • The effectiveness of school reform (teacher incentives, student
     incentives, affirmative action, etc)
   • General economic hypotheses about, e.g., returns to scale, elasticity of
     demand, cross price elasticities, markups, etc

Today’s Agenda
An introduction to hypothesis testing:

  • What is it?

  • Why do we do it?

  • How do we perform tests of population means with large samples?

    • One sample tests

    • Two sample tests

The Big Picture

 Hypothesis testing is a formal way of combining:

       1) Our probability framework for uncertainty, and
       2) Observed facts or data, with
       3) An explicit decision rule
             to form precise quantitative conclusions
             about uncertain situations.

Hypothesis Testing: Intuition
Our coin flipping example demonstrates the following
three step intuition:

 • Default Assumption:         Coin is fair.


 • Conservative Approach:     Favors default assumption: moderately
   unlikely outcomes must be due to chance.


 • Reject Default:    We reject the default assumption if we observe
   an outcome that would be highly unlikely if the default assumption
   were true.

Jury Selection
In theory, panels of jurors in America are drawn randomly from a list of
eligible citizens in a court’s jurisdiction. In the 1950s and 1960s, some
district courts were alleged to have too few African American jurors.

    This led some defendants to charge that they had not received a fair trial.

Jury Selection
In theory, panels of jurors in America are drawn randomly from a list of
eligible citizens in a court’s jurisdiction. In the 1950s and 1960s, some
district courts were alleged to have too few African American jurors.

    This led some defendants to charge that they had not received a fair trial.

    In a famous case (Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 545 (1967)), of 90 potential
    jurors only 7 were African American. The court established that 27% of
    eligible citizens in the district were African American.

    A statistician was brought in to testify about the odds that the observed
    panel was the result of random chance.
Jury Selection
Assume for the sake of argument
that the potential jurors were
randomly selected.

What is the probability distribution of
the number of African Americans on
the 90-person panel? (The district
was 27% African American)


A. Normal
B. Poisson
C. Binomial
D. Bernoulli

Americans or less? i.e., Prob(X≤7) = ?
Quarter of Birth and Schooling
Most states require children
entering first grade to be 6 years
old by the end of the calendar
year.

How much schooling do kids born
in the first quarter (Jan-Mar) go on
to acquire relative to kids born in
the fourth quarter?


A. 1st quarter kids get more
B. 1st quarter kids get less
C. Quarter of birth makes no
   difference

Quarter of Birth and Schooling
Angrist and Krueger (1991) use a 5% sample from the
1980 US Census to answer this question.

They observe 81,671 individuals born in the first quarter
between 1930 and 1939. Mean education in this group is
12.69 years, and standard deviation is 3.310 years.

The nationwide average years of education for the 1930-39
cohort is 12.77 years.

How unusual would it be to observe our sample data if the
mean for this sub-population is the same as the national
average?

The Null versus the Alternative Hypothesis
• The data suggest 1Q kids get less schooling, but the
 observed difference is just 0.08 years so maybe it’s just
 sampling variation.

  • Is the observed difference real or is it due to chance?

• The null hypothesis (H0) says that an observed
 difference reflects pure chance variation.

• The alternative hypothesis (H1 or Ha) says that the
 observed difference is real.

Hypotheses
How do hypotheses fit into our probability framework?
 • Sample. Think of the sample data as n = 81,671 independent
   random variables from a population with unknown mean µ.
   • Xi is completed schooling for observation i (i = 1, 2, ..., 81671).


 • Hypothesis. If our null hypothesis is true, where is the
   distribution of the sample average, X, centered?

                            12.77 years (the national average)
In Symbols:

The null hypothesis:               H0: µ = 12.77.
    (The observed difference just reflects random chance: We should expect a value
    of 12.77 in another sample.)

The alternative hypothesis:        H1: µ ¹ 12.77.
    (The observed difference is real: 1Q kids acquire a different amount of schooling
    than the national average.)

Z is (approximately) a standard normal r.v. in large samples.

Interpretation: The z-statistic measures how many SE’s the
observed value is from its expected value if H0 is true.

Decision Rules
 Decision Rules: In hypothesis testing problems, we typically
 use a reject/do not reject rule for explaining the outcome of the
 test.
   The conventional decision rule is

                           Reject if p-value < a



 The decision rule, a, is usually set at 0.05.
     Meaning: We want there to be only a 5% chance
     that we erroneously reject a true hypothesis.


 Some testers prefer not to make reject/do not reject
 statements. Instead, they report the p-value and let others
 evaluate its “significance” using their own rules.

Statistical Significance
If we can reject the hypothesis that an observed
difference is due to random chance, the difference is
called statistically significant.

                                                         28




Implications of compulsory schooling laws
If 3Q kids or 4Q kids drop out at age 16, they will have
completed the same 10 years of schooling.

This implies there should be no significant difference
between 3Q kids and 4Q kids.

How do we test this?

Our new probability model
Schooling for Q3 kids is X1: E[X1] = μ1, Var[X1] = σ2
Schooling for Q4 kids is X2: E[X2] = μ2, Var[X2] = σ2

For now, assume variance of the two populations is the same.

Our new probability model
Schooling for Q3 kids is X1: E[X1] = μ1, Var[X1] = σ2
Schooling for Q4 kids is X2: E[X2] = μ2, Var[X2] = σ2

For now, assume variance of the two populations is the same.

Want to test H0: μ1 = μ2
